Entelechy
=========

Entelechy is perfection, the essence fully realized.
It's a vital force that directs an human to singularity.
This is not an attempt, is an achievement.

The idea of Entelechy was inspired by themes such as Divergence IV and Zorin OS 8,
but with a proposal somewhat... different. No more, try it.
